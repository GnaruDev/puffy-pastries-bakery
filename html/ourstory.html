					Our bakery started with a dream and a cream puff. When we first started our cream puff recipes were what we started with. These recipes won local dessert competitions and eventually led to our name.  We started our first shop in Houston making a humble living out of a small shop and have expanded over the years.

				<p class="clsostory">
				 With that being said, we are a locally grown business and we will always call Houston home. Our excellent staff start the day early, baking and preparing to open the shop and the smell of our baked goods linger in the streets drawing in new customers all the time. If you happen by our shop, stop in and take a look around our team will always be glad to welcome you! We plan to continue growing our business here at home and we thank you for your patronage!
